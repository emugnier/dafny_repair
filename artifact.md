# OOPSLA artifact

## Intro

This artifact contains:
- the Laurel tool
    - the assertion placeholder algorithm
    - the algorithm for in-context example selection
- the DafnyGym benchmark
- scripts to run the paper experiments and generate the figures

## Hardware dependencies

No particular hardware dependencies are required. The Docker image is less than 2GB, and the experiments can be run on a laptop.
The main requirement is to have an internet connection to be able to call the GPT API. You need to have a GPT API with some credits to run the experiments.

Although unlikely, hardware differences might affect the verification results.
